# Overview
### Supporting a team of delivery drivers or techs working in the field can be challenging. Often times, there is a dispatcher or office admin that can help organize their travel plans and keep everyone updated. 

### This app uses Google Maps to generate driving directions based on your team's location so dispatchers and office admins can quickly send navigation links to their team. 

# Highlights of the app
- Users can select different team members to view their location on a map
- Users can generate driving directions from their current location to the selected team member
- Users can add a new map pin, and generate driving directions from the team member to a custom location
